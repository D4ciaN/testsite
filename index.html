        <h3>Possible Locations</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sarcophagus</strong>. Sarcophagus itself holds the almighty Monolith Cristal. At least that's what everyone belives. It is highly possible that the <em>Shard</em> itself to be found here</li>

            <li>Generators. Even tho it is quite impossible to reach that area because of the radiation.</li>
